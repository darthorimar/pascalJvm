# PascalJvm
Translator from Pascal to the Jvm bytecode made for the Great Justice and learning Scala!

Supports very small subset of Pascal language like:
* `integer`/`string`/`bool` expressions, variables and consts
* `if` statements
* `for`/`while` loops
* user input and output

Has some examples of working Pascal programs in the test_programs/ dir
